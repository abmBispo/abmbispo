### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working at RaroLabs (Belo Horizonte, Brazil), mainly on Rails, altough recently introduced to React SPA.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning computer science by myself following the standard international curriculum. I left UFMG university to dedicate my free time to studies on programming languages for web, distributed computing, algorithms and databases. 
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on disruptive open source iniciatives using Elixir/Erlang or Ruby.
- 💬 I'm really open to feedback to my personal projects, so I'd appreciate it if you help me to become a better software developer 😄. 
- 📫 You can reach me out at email or Linkedin:
